Yash: yet another shell
=======================


Yash is a implementation of command line shell, personally developed
by Magicant. It is under development aiming at complete comformance to
POSIX.1 (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition).


Yash is free software, distributed under the terms of GPL.
See the file COPYING for more info.

See the file INSTALL to find how to build and install Yash.

Currently there is no manpage for yash. Sorry.


===== Notes =====

 * In C, a null character represents the end of string. If input from
   a file or a string in itself contains a null character, the
   following characters will be neglected.
 * The GCC extension keyword `__attribute__' is used in the source
   codes. When not compiled with GCC, this keyword is removed by
   preprocessor, so generally there is no harm. But if your compiler
   uses this keyword for any other purpose, compilation may fail.
   Additionally, some other identifiers starting with '_' may cause
   compilation errors on some rare environments.
 * When -e (-o errexit) option is set, failure of the last command of
   an and/or list makes the shell exit. This behavior is not strictly
   POSIX-compliant, but most existing shells behave this way.
 * According to POSIX, the variable 'PS1' is subject to parameter
   expandsion. Yash also performs command substitution and arithmetic
   expandsion on 'PS1'.
