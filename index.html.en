<h1 id="title">Yash</h1>

<p>Yash, yet another shell, is a POSIX-compliant command line shell
written by <span class='surname'>Watanabe</span> Yuki (aka magicant) in C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999).
It was originally written as a work on a university course assignment but
the code has been re-written from scratch to meet the requirement of POSIX.
Yash is intended to be the most POSIX-compliant shell in the world.
<p>Yash can be modified/redistributed under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(Version 2) but the use of this program is
<strong>without any warranty</strong>.

Yash is an OSDN-hosted project. See also the
<a href="//osdn.jp/projects/yash/">project summary page</a>.

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Yash is supposed to build and run on any POSIX.1-2001 environment
with the Software Development Utilities and the C-Language Development Utilities
options.

<h2 id="progress">Current Development Status</h2>
<p>Most of the basic functions required by POSIX have already been implemented,
so that yash is now capable of running common shell scripts.
Basic line-editing and command completion have also been developed.
The author is currently developing auxiliary scripts to make command completion
more usable.

<h2 id="downloads">Downloads</h2>
<p>The source tarball can be downloaded from the
<a href="//osdn.jp/projects/yash/releases/">release page</a>
(or the <a href="releases">release list</a>).
<p>The <a href="doc/">manual</a> is available online.
