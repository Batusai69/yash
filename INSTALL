How to Build and Install Yash


A normal way to build and install Yash is:

  1. In your shell, `cd' to the directory containing this file.

  2. Type `sh configure' to run the configuration script. This script
     checks which features are available on your system and creates
	 files to build Yash.

  3. Type `make' to build Yash.

  4. Optionally, type `make test' to check if Yash works right.

  5. Type `make install' to install yash. By default, Yash is installed
     at /usr/local/bin/yash.

The `configure' script chooses a compiler to compile Yash. GCC is
preferred if available. If GCC is unavailable, `c99' is used, which is
defined by POSIX.

The `configure' script accepts following options, which affect the
way Yash is built and installed:

  --debug
          Lower the optimization level of the compiler to make it easy
		  to debug Yash. Only valid for GCC.
  --with-readline
          Enable line editing with GNU Readline Library even if
		  `configure' script cannot find the correct linker option.
		  You need to define the correct linker option yourself.
  --without-readline
          Disable line editing with GNU Readline Library.

  --bindir=DIR
          Install Yash in DIR, rather than /usr/local/bin.

To static-link GNU Readline Library, copy a pre-compiled `libreadline.a`
file into this directory and then do `configure'.

Following environment variables override `configure' script's choices:

  CC
          The name of Compiler/linker.
  CFLAGS
          Options given to the compiler.
  LDFLAGS
          Options given to the linker.
  INSTALL_PROGRAM
          The name of the installer.

Following environment variables affect `configure' script's choices:

  CADDS
          Additional options given to the compiler.
  LDADDS, LIBS
          Additional options given to the linker.


Typing `make uninstall' uninstalls the program.
Typing `make clean' deletes object files and executables.
Typing `make distclean' deletes any files that are made by `configure'
or during build.
