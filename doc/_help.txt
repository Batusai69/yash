//:title: Yash manual - Help built-in

The dfn:[help built-in] prints usage of built-ins.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +help [{{built-in}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The help built-in prints a description of {{built-in}}s.

The built-in extracts part of the output of +man yash+ and prints it to the
standard output.
Therefore, the manual page of yash must have been installed for the built-in
to work.
Depending on the formatting style of the man command, the built-in may not
work as expected.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{built-in}}s::
Names of link:builtin.html[built-ins].

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the help built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The help built-in is not defined in the POSIX standard.

Many built-in of yash accepts the +--help+ option that prints the same
description.
