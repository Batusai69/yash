the last one.

The index of a directory stack entry you want to remove.
+
If omitted, `+0` (the last entry) is assumed.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the popd built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

It is an error to use this built-in when there is only one directory stack
entry.

The popd built-in is an link:builtin.html#types[elective built-in].
It cannot be used in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode]
because POSIX does not define its behavior.
