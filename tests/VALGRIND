To test yash with Valgrind, run "make test-valgrind" in this directory.
Yash must have been built without enabling any of the following variables
in config.h:

 * HAVE_PROC_SELF_EXE
 * HAVE_PROC_CURPROC_FILE
 * HAVE_PROC_OBJECT_AOUT

Otherwise, some tests would fail after Valgrind is invoked as a shell where
yash should be invoked.

Some tests are skipped to avoid false failures.
